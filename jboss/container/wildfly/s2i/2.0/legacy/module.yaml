  description: "In case you want to set Maven or S2I build related env variables (repositories, mirrors, arguments, ...) but not want them exposed in the generated server builder, you can suffix the env variable with '_WILDFLY_SERVER_BUILDER'. For example setting 'MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND_WILDFLY_SERVER_BUILDER=-Dfoo=bar' env variable would make 'MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND=-Dfoo=bar' to be set during the build."
