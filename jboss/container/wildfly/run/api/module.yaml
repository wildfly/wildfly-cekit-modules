description: Env variable to configure the server for cloud execution. JVM is automatically configured, all Java VM related env variables are supported.

envs:
- name: CLI_EXECUTION_OUTPUT
  description: By default executed CLI script output is redirected to '/tmp/server-cli-execution-output-file.txt' file (or '/tmp/cli-script-output-<system-time>.cli' when cloud feature-pack is used). Set this env variable to 'CONSOLE' for output to be displayed in the console. Set this env variable to a file path for output to be redirected in the provided file.
- name: CLI_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN
  description: Set this variable to true to disable server shutdown. You are then in charge to explicitly kill the server by your own mean.
- name: CLI_LAUNCH_SCRIPT
  description: A path to a CLI script to execute at server launch time. The path can be absolute or relative to $JBOSS_HOME directory. If an error occurs during script execution, the server startup aborts and CLI errors are displayed in the console. Management operations that imply a restart of the server are not supported in such CLI script.
- name: JAVA_OPTS_APPEND
  description: To append options to JAVA_OPTS env variable.
- name: JBOSS_NODE_NAME
  description: Set jboss.node.name property value.
- name: JBOSS_TX_NODE_ID
  description: Set transactions subsystem node-identifier property value. By default set as truncated to last 23 characters name based on the hostname is computed.
- name: PORT_OFFSET
  description: Use this env variable to set the server port offset. This is advised practice instead of directly setting jboss.socket.binding.port-offset in the SERVER_ARGS. It allows the server shutdown logic to connect to the running server to do a clean CLI shutdown. 
- name: SERVER_ARGS
  description: In order to provide arguments to the launched server.
- name: SERVER_ENABLE_STATISTICS
  description: True by default. That is the value passed to '-Dwildfly.statistics-enabled' system property when launching the server. Set it to 'false' to disable statistics.
- name: SERVER_LAUNCH_SCRIPT_OVERRIDE
  description: In order to override the server launch script called by the image entry-point, set this env variable to the name of a bash file located in the '$JBOSS_HOME/bin' directory.
- name: SERVER_MANAGEMENT_BIND_ADDRESS
  description: By default the management interface is bound to 0.0.0.0 address. You can change this default using this env variable.
- name: SERVER_PUBLIC_BIND_ADDRESS
  description: By default the public interface is bound to the hostname ip address. You can change this default using this env variable.
